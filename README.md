# Cryptocurrencies

For this analysis, we review all the tradable currencies, classify them into certain groups and determine which ones are worth investing in. 
In order to do so, we practice the following. 

- [x] Data Scaling 
- [x] Principal Component Analysis
- [x] KMeans to determine clusters

All of which were performed using Jupyter Notebook in conjunctions with the Pandas and ScikitLearn libraries.
